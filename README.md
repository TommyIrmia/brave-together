# #העצמה אחת ביום - Brave-Together Hackathon project

## Summey
Web app brings together a variety of heroic Holocaust survivors stories and allows users to create and design a post that can be shared on social networks.

## How it workes
The app allows you to create custom hero posts. Users can choose:
 1) Background 
 2) Images to be integrated
 3) Quote. When selecting the quote, you can choose from an existing citation database by topic, or specific text from the hero stories that exist in the app.
